# Quictionary
Quictionary is a powerful flashcard study tool and a multilingual dictionary combined into one application to allow for quick and easy studying.

This application is meant to act as a companion app to allow language learners to engage with many types of content in their target language while pulling words and phrases to study in Quictionary. This application is being developed for iOS using SwiftUI and Core Data.
